          I'm <strong>Sergei Parshev</strong>. I've spent {{ sub now.Year 2005 }}+ years in IT as an engineer and a hacker. I started my career in Russia and eventually moved into leadership, running <span class="lh-tip">DevOps<span class="lh-tip-box"><strong>DevOps</strong>A modern approach to building software where development and operations teams work together to ship updates faster and more reliably. Think of it as the bridge between writing code and running it in the real world.</span></span> teams in top-tier companies. Now, I’ve traded the corporate grind for a calm lakehouse in Clermont, Florida. I had great mentors, who helped me get here, and now I want to pass that torch.

      <h2>The Lakehouse Approach</h2>
      <p>Not a school, not a tutor — a real mentorship that fits your family</p>

          <span style="color:var(--color-accent);font-size:1.5rem;">01</span> Family First
        </h3>
        <p>I believe the best support starts with a strong partnership with the parents. I’d love to begin with a casual meet-and-greet consultation at your home or a local coffee shop where we will chat and see if we’re a good fit. Getting to know the family first allows us to build a foundation of trust and transparency before I begin working with your child.</p>

        </h3>
        <p>If we all agree it’s a good match, we move forward with our first session. The transition is designed to feel comfortable and purposeful as I begin my role as a mentor with specialized expertise in technology and practical execution. My goal is to build a professional rapport where your child feels motivated and ready to learn.</p>

        </h3>
        <p>Time at the lakehouse is filled with projects, tinkering, lake activities, and conversations. Instead of artificial entertainment, we focus on genuine experiences and practical problem-solving within a secure, supportive environment.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="feature-card animate-in delay-3" style="text-align:left;">

        </h3>
        <p>Progress reports, ongoing support, and a mentor they can always call. The goal is to spark curiosity and ignite love for life that carries through years, not just weekends.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="feature-card animate-in delay-4" style="text-align:left;">

        </h3>
        <p>Your family’s peace of mind is my priority. Maintaining an open, transparent environment ensures everyone feels safe and confident, allowing us to focus entirely on your child’s growth and technical development.</p>
