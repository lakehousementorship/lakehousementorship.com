## My Story

I'm Sergei Parshev — a seasoned DevOps engineer, tinkerer, hacker, musician, and lifelong learner. With over {{< years-experience >}} years in the IT industry, I've led DevOps teams at top companies, contributed to open-source projects, built everything from smart home systems to custom drones. I navigated the path from Russia to the hear of Silicon Valley, ultimately finding my place by a pieceful lake in Clermont, Florida.

But my real story isn't about corporate titles. It's about the mentors who changed my life and my burning desire to do the same for the next generation.

## Why I Started Lakehouse Mentorship

We are living in an unprecedented era. Artificial intelligence, humanoid robots, brain-computer interfaces — the pace of change is breathtaking. It's fascinating and exciting, but it also raises a critical question: **how will the next generation keep up?**

Public education moves too slowly. Teachers, through no fault of their own, often can't keep pace with technologies that evolve weekly. Schools are becoming increasingly disconnected from the real-world skills that matter. And YouTube and social media tutorials could be helpful, but won't substitute for human guidance, especially when you're young and yet have no grasp on life.

**That's where real mentorship makes the difference.**

I've been fortunate to have incredible mentors throughout my life — people who saw my potential, challenged me, and helped me navigate the unknown. A.V. helped me with initial programming while I was young, K.E. guided me through the complexity of automation and B.H. taught me business soft skills that seriously helped me improve communication with the colleagues. Multiple folks across countries showed me that with the right approach, *anything is possible*.

Now it's my turn to pass that torch.

## What Makes Me Different

I'm not a teacher who can only teach. I'm a **practitioner** who lives and breathes what I share:

- **20+ years in IT** — DevOps, software architecture, security, cloud infrastructure, automation
- **Hands-on maker** — 3D printing, CNC, soldering, PCB design, microcontrollers, home automation
- **Security mindset** — Ethical hacking, reverse engineering, cryptocurrency systems
- **Creative soul** — Guitar player, music production, band experience
- **Cross-cultural perspective** — Born in Russia, thrived in America, fluent in bridging different worlds
- **Real-world builder** — From smart home setups to custom drones to open-source contributions

## My Approach

I don't believe in forced learning. Instead, I believe in:

> Show that anything is possible with the right approach — then watch curiosity do the rest.

Every mentorship begins with getting to know your family. A genuine conversation. If we click, your child is welcome to spend time at the lakehouse — not as a student in a classroom, but as a young mind hanging out with the mentor being offered an opportunity to implement any kind of idea in the workshop full of incredible tools, a studio with guitars, and a lake right outside.

The learning happens naturally through projects, challenges, conversations, and yes — the occasional scrape or failed experiment. Because that's how real growth works.

## Beyond Technology

While tech is my primary domain, mentorship at the lakehouse goes far beyond code:

- **Life skills**: How to think critically, solve problems, and stay curious
- **Resilience**: Learning from failure, developing healthy discipline
- **Communication**: Negotiation, pitching ideas, working with others
- **Self-reliance**: Fixing things, building things, understanding how the world works
- **Cultural bridge**: Optional Russian language immersion in a native environment

## The Lakehouse

Our home on the lake in Clermont, FL isn't just a location — it's part of the experience. A peaceful setting where creativity flows naturally, distractions fade away, and young minds can focus on what truly matters. Projects at the workbench, jam sessions by the water, conversations that spark lifelong curiosity.
