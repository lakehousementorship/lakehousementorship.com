## The First Step Is a Conversation

Lakehouse Mentorship isn't something you sign up for like a class — it's a relationship that starts with a genuine connection. Here's how it works:

### 1. Reach Out
Fill out the form below. Tell me a bit about your child — age, interests (or lack thereof!), and what you're hoping to achieve.

### 2. We Chat
I'll get back to you within 24 hours to set up a brief phone call. We'll discuss your family's needs and see if there's a potential fit.

### 3. Family Meeting
If we both feel good about it, we will schedule a casual meet-up. No pressure, no pitch — just getting to know each other as real people.

### 4. Begin the Journey
If the connection clicks, we'll design a mentorship plan tailored to your child and schedule the first session at the lakehouse.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<img src="/images/faq.svg" alt="Frequently Asked Questions" class="content-illustration" loading="lazy">

**"My child has no interests at all — can you still help?"**
Absolutely. In fact, that's often where the most dramatic transformations happen. Kids aren't lazy — they're unmotivated. Give them the right environment and a mentor who genuinely cares, and watch what happens.

**"Is my child too young / too old?"**
I prefer to work with ages 11-17, but I'm flexible. If your child is mature for their age or a late bloomer, let's talk.

**"We're not local — is online worth it?"**
Yes, especially if your child already has a direction or project in mind. The online format works best as a focused, project-driven mentorship. For the full immersive experience, in-person is unmatched.

**"What if it doesn't work out?"**
No hard feelings. Meeting with a family exists specifically to make sure there's a genuine fit before any commitment. Not every mentor-mentee pairing works, and that's okay.
