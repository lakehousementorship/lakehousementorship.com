Your child's future is priceless — and that's why Lakehouse Mentorship is an investment in premium, transformative experiences. No boring endless classes. No overcrowded group sessions. Just tailored mentorship that produces real, lasting results.

**Why the premium pricing?** Because this is intentionally not scalable. I have a limited number of hours, and each one is devoted entirely to your child. Every session is custom-designed, deeply personal, and backed by {{< years_in_it >}} of real-world expertise.

## Personal In-Person Mentorship
*The Premium Lakehouse Experience*

**$600 per full day (8 hours)** | **$3,000 for a 5-day immersion week**

This is the flagship experience — full-day immersion at the lakehouse where your child is surrounded by tools, technology, creativity, and hands-on learning.

### What's included:
- **Meeting kickoff** — We start by meeting at your home or a local coffee shop. We get to know each other as families, not clients. This builds the trust that makes everything else work.
- **Custom project design** — Based on your child's interests, I design a hands-on journey that might span coding, building, music, or all of the above.
- **Full-day immersion** — 8 hours of mentorship, including structured project time, exploratory tinkering, lake activities, meals, and genuine conversation.
- **Detailed progress reports** — After each session, you receive a summary of what we did, what your child excelled at, and suggested next steps.
- **Ongoing support** — Between sessions, your child can reach out with questions. A real mentor doesn't clock out.

### Ideal for:
- Ages 11-17
- Families in the Clermont/Orlando area
- Kids who need deep, immersive experiences
- Parents looking for more than a tutor

## Online Mentorship
*The Flexible Remote Plan*

**$200 per 2-hour session** | **$1,500 for 8-session monthly package**

For families who aren't local to central Florida or want a lighter touch, the online plan delivers focused, project-based mentorship through video calls.

### What's included:
- **Virtual 1:1 sessions** — Video calls with screen sharing, live coding, and project walkthrough.
- **Project guidance** — We pick a goal together (e.g., build a drone app, create a website, learn guitar basics), then work toward it week by week.
- **Homework challenges** — Between sessions, your child gets specific tasks to keep momentum going.
- **Resource sharing** — Curated tools, tutorials, and materials tailored to your child's path.
- **Async Q&A** — Quick questions via chat between sessions, so your child never feels stuck alone.

### Ideal for:
- Remote families anywhere in the world
- Kids who already have a direction but need expert guidance
- Quick boosts on specific projects or skills
- Supplemental mentorship alongside in-person sessions

## Frequently Asked Questions

<img src="/images/faq.svg" alt="Frequently Asked Questions" class="content-illustration" loading="lazy">

**Is this really worth the investment?**
Consider what you spend on activities that don't create lasting change. Lakehouse Mentorship is designed to spark a lifelong trajectory — curiosity, skills, and confidence that compound over years. One transformative mentorship experience can be worth more than years of traditional classes.

**What if my child doesn't connect with Sergei?**
That's exactly why we start with a meeting in person — no commitment. If the chemistry isn't right, there's no obligation. This only works when the connection is genuine.

**What about safety?**
Safety is paramount. The lakehouse environment is family-friendly, and I'm committed to creating a space where kids can explore and take reasonable risks while staying safe. I'm happy to discuss specific safety protocols during our initial meeting.

**Can my child just try one session?**
Absolutely. There's no long-term commitment required. Many families start with a single day to see if it's a fit.

**Do you offer refunds?**
If you're not satisfied with the experience, let's talk about it. I'd rather have happy families than unhappy contracts.
