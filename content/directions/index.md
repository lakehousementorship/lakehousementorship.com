Every child is different. That's why Lakehouse Mentorship doesn't follow a one-size-fits-all curriculum. Instead, we discover what excites your child and build from there. Here are the core directions we explore — though the real magic happens when they intersect.

## 1. IT & Tech Mastery

**For the future builders, hackers, and digital creators.**

In a world increasingly driven by technology, deep tech fluency isn't optional — it's essential. But it shouldn't feel like school. At the lakehouse, we learn by *building*.

**What we cover:**
- Basics, operating systems, networking, and how the internet really works
- Modern programming languages and software architecture
- Web, mobile, and desktop application development
- DevOps practices, automation tools, and cloud infrastructure
- Security fundamentals and ethical hacking
- Cryptocurrency theory, P2P systems, and blockchain basics
- AI integration and working with modern AI tools
- Open-source contributions and real-world code reviews
- Gainig experience and preparing for real company environments

**Example projects:** Build a personal website from scratch, create a Telegram bot, set up a secure home server, contribute to an open-source project, build your first crypto wallet.

## 2. DIY & Making

**For the kids who need to touch, build, and create with their hands.**

There's something magical about turning an idea into a physical object. The maker direction bridges digital design with tangible creation.

**What we cover:**
- **Additive manufacturing**: 3D printing (FDM, resin), design software (Fusion 360, TinkerCAD)
- **Subtractive methods**: Manual crafting, milling, CNC basics
- **Microcontrollers**: Arduino, Raspberry Pi, ESP32 — sensors, motors, and automation
- **Electronics**: Soldering, circuit design, PCB layout and fabrication
- **Drone building**: From kit assembly to custom frames and flight controllers
- **Smart devices**: IoT projects, home automation gadgets

**Example projects:** Design and 3D-print a custom phone stand, build an Arduino weather station, assemble a racing drone from scratch, create a smart doorbell.

## 3. Home & Practical Life Skills

**For building confidence and self-reliance in the real world.**

Kids today can code an app but can't change a fuse. This direction fixes that — making sure your child understands how the physical world works.

**What we cover:**
- Diagnosing and fixing household appliances
- Basic electrical work and safety protocols
- Plumbing fundamentals and maintenance
- Smart home setup and automation (Home Assistant, Zigbee)
- Real-life physics laws and chemistry (ex. engine & pool)
- Tool usage, workshop safety, and DIY repair mindset

**Example projects:** Set up a smart home hub, diagnose why the dishwasher stopped working, build a home weather monitoring system, wire a simple circuit.

## 4. Music & Creative Expression

**For the soul — because discipline and joy go hand in hand.**

Music isn't just art — it's fine motor skills, math, focus, timing, teamwork, and emotional expression all at once. The lakehouse has guitars, recording equipment, and a vibe that makes music natural.

**What we cover:**
- Electric and acoustic guitar basics to intermediate
- Music theory fundamentals (enough to be dangerous)
- Recording: DAWs, microphones, and production basics
- Sequencers and electronic music creation
- Band formation, rehearsal discipline, and collaboration
- Performance confidence — from living room jams to small gigs

**Example projects:** Learn 5 songs on guitar, record a demo track, create a beat using a DAW, organize a jam session with other kids.

## 5. Entrepreneurship, Soft Skills & Adventure

**For turning curiosity into real-world action.**

The most valuable skills aren't always technical. This direction focuses on the mindset, communication, and hustle that turn ideas into reality.

**What we cover:**
- **Entrepreneurship**: Idea validation, no-code startups, crypto ventures, building a pitch
- **Soft skills**: Communication, negotiation, failure resilience, goal-setting
- **Outdoor adventure**: Drone flying, nature exploration, survival basics
- **Mindset work**: Growth mindset, dealing with setbacks, healthy discipline
- **Cultural bridge**: Optional Russian language learning in a native environment

**Example projects:** Validate a business idea and pitch it, set up an online store, fly a drone through an obstacle course, plan and execute a weekend outdoor challenge.

## How Directions Combine

The real power of Lakehouse Mentorship is how these directions *intersect*. A child interested in drones might learn:

- **Tech**: Flight controller programming and sensor integration
- **Making**: Custom 3D-printed frame and soldered electronics
- **Practical**: Understanding physics of flight and battery safety
- **Entrepreneurship**: Starting a drone photography side gig
- **Music**: Creating a soundtrack for their drone footage

That's holistic mentorship — and it's what makes this approach truly transformative.
